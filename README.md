<h2>Discription</h2>

When you click buttons, still image of gifs show up. When you click the gif image, gif becomes animated. When you click again, it goes back to the still image.

I placed the input box on the right for users to create more animal gif buttons.

Buttons, input box, and still/animated functions were created with javascript.

JSON was used to call the gifs from giphy website by using its API.
