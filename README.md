Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON

When you click buttons, still image of gifs show up. When you click the gif image, gif becomes animated. When you click again, it goes back to the still image. 

I placed the input box on the right for users to create more animal gif buttons.

Buttons, input box, and still/animated functions were created with javascript.

JSON was used to call the gifs from giphy website by using its API.
